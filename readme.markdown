# Sigly

Sigly is an event/delegate (signal/slot) mechanism implementation for C++.

Library is written in C++03 and does not use C++11 features.

To use the library, add the sigly.h file to the list of the system include directories or
to your project.

You can specify which multi-thread policy you want by defining a macro before including sigly or
by defining it directly in the define.h file. The macros are described in the following quick
documentation.
